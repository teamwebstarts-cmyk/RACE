# RACE — Active State

> **Updated:** 2026-10-07
> **Read this first in every new session.**

---

## Current Objective

**Cloud production** is the active delivery path. Before any Render/Vercel/EAS work, read **`docs/ops/CLOUD_PRODUCTION_RUNBOOK.md`** (IDs, env names, MCP map, pre-flight checklist).

Product work continues on `v2.5.2-development` (customer/admin/backend as requested).

## Active Branch

`v2.5.2-development` (HEAD) — this is the current work branch.
Previous cleanup branch `v2.0.1-cleanup` was merged/superseded.

## Phase

Cloud-hosted API (Render) + admin (Vercel) + customer Android APK (Expo EAS `@webstarts/race-service`).

## Completed Work

- [x] Local environment fully running (Backend :3000, Admin :3001, Customer :8081, Partner :8082, MongoDB :27017)
- [x] All 4 surfaces: deps installed, TypeScript clean, Vite proxy configured
- [x] Database seeded; 40-case comprehensive audit 100% pass
- [x] System audit documented (`docs/SYSTEM_AUDIT_AND_TEST_CASES.md`)
- [x] Gap analysis documented (`docs/RACE_REMAINING_WORK_AND_GAPS.md`) — 57→95/100 plan
- [x] Mock testing mode + universal OTP + data seeders + playbook
- [x] Complete pixel-perfect redesign of Customer mobile app core screens based on reference mockups:
  - `HomeScreen.tsx`: Pure white background, sticky top bar with location pill dropdown, highlighted greeting ("Good afternoon, Welcome! 👋"), road scenery atmospheric background extending 100% full-bleed edge-to-edge (`left: -px(20)`, `width: width`) with zero side gaps, shifted higher (`top: -px(56)`, `height: px(380)`) behind "Good afternoon", dual-ended LinearGradient melting both top edge and bottom road edge seamlessly into pure solid `#FFFFFF` eliminating hard cuts/corners, custom SVG curved 24/7 card with dipped notch starting right beside "24/7", smooth rounded top-right corner (`R_tr = px(24)`), multi-stop continuous ease gradient on the card eliminating transition lines and graduating to `stopOpacity="0.45"` on the right corner for crystal-clear tow truck visibility while maintaining 100% solid white contrast on the left for text, native bottom drop shadow (`elevation: 4`, `shadowOpacity: 0.10`), lower card position (`marginTop: px(58)`), single-line "Roadside Assistance" title, 2-line subtitle ("Reliable help, anytime,\nanywhere in Bhubaneswar."), tightened gap to Request Help button, highlighted golden-gradient Request Help CTA, highlighted Our Services icons, and 2x2 Popular Services grid.
  - `ServicesScreen.tsx`: Top header with highlighted 23px "Services" title and back button, increased card height (`px(150)`), wider cards (`paddingHorizontal: px(14)`), borderless design with soft shadows (`shadowColor: '#000', elevation: 3`), right-anchored artwork container (`width: '58%'`, `height: '92%'`) displaying tow truck, driver, mechanic wrench, and car visuals cropped on the right with no top/bottom overflow, and gentle left fog gradient overlay ensuring text sits on clean white/yellow background with zero wash-out of right-side subjects.
  - `TowingServiceScreen.tsx`: Highway tow truck photo banner, 3-stat quick trust bar (30 min arrival, Verified drivers, Safe & insured), 3 towing options with Book Now buttons, Why Choose Us grid, sticky dual action bar (Call Now & Book Towing).
  - `DriverServiceScreen.tsx`: Photo banner with green "Drivers Available" badge, 4 driver options (Part-Time, Full-Time, Outstation, Night), Why Choose Us grid, sticky Call Now & Book Driver bar.
  - `RoadsideAssistanceScreen.tsx`: Photo banner with "Available Now - 25 min" badge, 4 roadside options (Flat Tyre, Battery Jumpstart, Fuel Delivery, Minor Mechanical Fix), Why Choose Us grid, sticky Call Now & Book Service bar.
  - `MoreServicesScreen.tsx`: Yellow hero banner with "Coming Soon" pill, 6 upcoming service cards with "Soon" status badges.
  - `LocationSelectorSheet.tsx`: Top grab handle, back button, "Set your location", search pill, "or" divider, "Use my current location", "Select on map" divider, "Open Map Picker", and popular city chips.
  - `LocationPickerMap.tsx`: Clean header, floating search bar pill on top, yellow pin with blue accuracy circle & dot, floating locate button, bottom sheet with address title & edit icon, and yellow "Use this location" button.
  - `AppNavigator.tsx`: Reordered bottom tab bar (Home, Bookings, SOS, Services, Profile) matching design mockup.

## Active Work

Context engineering session — see `AGENTS.md` for new architecture.

## Known Blockers

None. Waiting on next product task.

## Known Gaps (Product — Not Started)

- [ ] Real payment gateway (stubs)
- [ ] Real OTP delivery (`SKIP_OTP_AUTH = true` in both apps)
- [ ] Driver KYC document upload to API
- [ ] Booking model fields: `towingMode`, `driverServiceType`
- [ ] Live GPS tracking on mobile (scaffold only)
- [ ] Admin reports query legacy `Booking` not real bookings
- [ ] Automated test framework (`backend/__tests__` empty)

## Important Files

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Project structure | `.agents/state/PROJECT_INDEX.md` |
| Decisions index | `.agents/state/DECISIONS_INDEX.md` |
| Gap/remaining work | `docs/RACE_REMAINING_WORK_AND_GAPS.md` |
| Backend layout | `backend/src/STRUCTURE.md` |

| Client overview | `docs/client/CLIENT_OVERVIEW.md` |

## Important Discoveries

- Expo SDK is **57** (^57.0.0), RN 0.86.3 — stale docs/memory may say 54 or 56, ignore them.
- Admin uses **Zustand + TanStack Query**, not Redux (CLIENT_FEATURES.md was wrong).
- `owner: 'race-service'` and MongoDB DB name `race-service` are strings, not the deleted folder.
- VPS is still on `release/13July26` — prod code does NOT match this workspace.
- `SKIP_OTP_AUTH = true` on both Expo login screens — real SMS via Twilio is configured but gated.
- Admin login: env-hardcoded in `backend/src/config/hardcoded-admin.ts`; `Admin` model unused for auth.

## Active Decisions

See `.agents/state/DECISIONS_INDEX.md` for all decisions.

## Next Action (When User Returns)

Choose from gap list above or ask user for priority. Do not deploy to VM until user asks.

## Do Not

- Push to `main`, `release4Aug2026`, `release/13July26`
- Recreate `customerweb/`, `partnerweb/`, `web application/`, `race-service/`
- Delete unused-looking screens without an import graph
- Commit `.env` or secrets
