## 5. How They Communicate (Data Connection Model)

1. **REST APIs (`http://localhost:3000/api/...`)**:
   - Used for non-realtime operations: Login, OTP request, profile updates, fetching booking histories, and administrative settings.
2. **WebSocket Events (Socket.IO)**:
   - Used for low-latency events:
     - `driver:location`: Emitted by Partner App every 5 seconds when online; forwarded to Customer App.
     - `job:broadcast`: Sent to eligible nearby drivers when a booking is created.
     - `booking:status`: Notifies Customer App when driver reaches or completes trip.
3. **Storage & Assets (GCS / Local)**:
   - Customer profile avatars, vehicle breakdown photos, driver licenses, and vehicle inspection images.
