# RACE Service — Client Feature Catalogue

> **What's in the box — every feature a user can touch, by audience and app**

This catalogue is the **client-facing source of truth** for what's been built in the `release4Aug2026` codebase. Every line corresponds to a real screen, page, route, or backend capability — nothing speculative.
